This work is for National Taiwan University 2016 Fall Data Mining HW1.
In this work, we implement the Eclact algorithm to mine frequent itemset.
The algorithm is implemented with both vertical transaction id sets (Tid) and bit sets (Bit).

Input file must has format "userid,timeid,itemid", where userid and timeid compose transaction id. The number of transaction id should not be larger than 3600000.

compile:
    ./make

run: 
    ./HW1 inputfile [outputprefix]

The execution file will automatically perform both Tid and Bit method under minsup 0.05% ~ 0.01% and show running time. The output files are the sorted frequent itemset with filename outputprefix_minsup_method. If the output file prefix argument is not given, the result would be shown in command line.

Recommend usage:
    mkdir r04921038_result
    ./HW1 data.txt r04921038_result/out
