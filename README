This work is for National Taiwan University 2016 Fall Data Mining HW1.
In this work, we implement the Eclact algorithm to mine frequent itemset.
The algorithm is implemented with both vertical transaction id sets (Tid) and bit sets (Bit).

Input file must has format "userid,timeid,itemid", where userid and timeid compose transaction id. The number of transaction id should not be larger than 3600000.

compile:
    ./make

run: 
    ./HW1 inputfile [outputfile]

The execution file will automatically perform both Tid and Bit method under minsup 0.05% ~ 0.01% and show running time. The output file is the sorted frequent itemset with minsup 0.01%. If the output file argument is not given, the result would be shown in command line.
